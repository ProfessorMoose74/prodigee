## Performance Considerations

### Polygon Counts

**Per Object Target**:
- Student Desk: 500 triangles
- Blackboard: 200 triangles
- Door: 300 triangles
- Window: 150 triangles
- Props (each): 100-300 triangles

**Total Scene Target**: < 50,000 triangles

### Texture Sizes

**Main Textures**:
- Floor: 2048 x 2048
- Walls: 2048 x 2048
- Furniture: 1024 x 1024 (atlas)
- Props: 512 x 512 (atlas)

**Compression**: ASTC (for Quest)

### Optimization

- Use texture atlasing for multiple objects
- Combine static meshes where possible
- Bake lighting (no real-time GI)
- Use LOD for detailed objects
- Occlusion culling enabled
- Single-pass instanced rendering (VR)
