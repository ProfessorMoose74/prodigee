# 1. Pull a Speech-to-Text model (e.g., Whisper)
# Note: As of now, Whisper is typically run outside Ollama. You'd use a separate service.
# For simplicity within the Ollama ecosystem, we assume a compatible STT model exists
# or use a general model fine-tuned for transcription tasks.

# 2. Pull a powerful Language Model (LLM)
ollama pull llama3 # For generating dialogue

# 3. Pull a multi-lingual model for embedding (for the library)
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large # For creating vector embeddings

# 4. For Text-to-Speech (TTS)
# Ollama does not have integrated TTS. You will need a separate service.
# A popular choice is Piper. You would run this as another service on this server.
# Installation for Piper would involve downloading binaries and voice models.
